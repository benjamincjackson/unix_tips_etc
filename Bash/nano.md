### Cut, copy, paste

The below commands will cut/copy entire lines. If you want to cut/copy multiple lines, then hit the command repeatedly for each line you want to cut/copy, then move your cursor to where you want to insert it, then hit `Ctrl + U` once

Copy - `Ctrl + K`  
Cut - `Alt + ^`  
Paste - `Ctrl + U`  
Selection portions of lines - `Alt + A` then move cursor with arrow keys  

To cut/copy portions of lines, move the cursor to the edge of the region you want to cut/copy, hit **`Alt + A`**, and then use the arrow keys to expand the selected area to cover all the text you want to cut/copy. Then you can use the commands above to cut/copy/paste it.
