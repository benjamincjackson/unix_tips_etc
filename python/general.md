Install pacakges for specific versions of Python (if you have more that one installed, which is likely) using pip in the following way:

```sh
pythonX.X -m pip install SomePackage
```

Where `X.X` is the Python version you want to install the packaged for, and `SomePackage` is the package you want to install, for example, Biopython.
